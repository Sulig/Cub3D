## Summary:
My first RayCaster with miniLibX -----------------------> <br/>

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. <br />
It will enable you to explore ray-casting. <br />
Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.
