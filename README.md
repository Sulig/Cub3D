## Summary:
My first RayCaster with miniLibX -----------------------> <br/>

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. <br />
It will enable you to explore ray-casting. <br />
Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

### WHY THIS `BRANCH`?
I will re-do this project *ONLY BY MYSELF*, because ~it was very insactisfactory...~ <br />
This is good work so far... but... IT CAN BE BETTER!! :>  <br />
So, this `branch` is a secure point of previous work.
