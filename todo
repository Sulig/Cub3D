* Issue v0:
 When repo cloned, the MLX42 MUST BE Compiled in the new address
 Using the same instruction as Codam provided:

	git clone https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42.git
	cd MLX42
	cmake -B build # build here refers to the outputfolder.
	cmake --build build -j4 # or do make -C build -j4
