# Cub3D TODO LIST

* Convert Raycast into 3D:
	** Needs improvement but is also done!
***

* Apply textures ~ IN PROGRESS ~
 - I got the wall direction!
	* Issue p1 -> The textures are not been represented correctly

// Maybe is a cuestion to "traslade" the texture
// ?- texel = (wall_witdh / tx_width) * (wall_height / tx_height)
/// ~ texel will be the scale of texture to move arround the path
// x & y position + texel

***

> [!WARNING]\
> Add exit(EXIT_FAILURE) on a error (*Probably ya doned... but still revision)
