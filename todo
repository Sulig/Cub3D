# Cub3D TODO LIST

* Convert Raycast into 3D:
	** Needs improvement but is also done!
***

* Apply textures ~ IN PROGRESS ~
 - I got the wall direction!
	* Issue p1 -> The textures are not been represented correctly

~ Is a cuestion to "traslade" the texture
?- texel = (wall_witdh / tx_width) * (wall_height / tx_height)
~ texel will be the scale of texture to move arround the path

* x & y -> position on texture to start
* width & heigth -> The scale of rect
* Maybe i will need to apply the rect to the texture?

- this is the prototype:
``` c
setTextureRect(tx, r_x, r_y, r_width, r_height)
```
