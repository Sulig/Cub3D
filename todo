# Cub3D TODO LIST

* Issue p0:
 The "A" && "D" commands are not working as intended

	** DONE!
***

* Convert Raycast into 3D:
	** Needs improvement but is also done!
***

* Apply textures
	IN PROGRESS ~

	* Issue p1 -> The texture to apply it is not been asigned correctly.

	* ~ Idea for apply diferent textures:
	Now i have these:
	```
		mlx_resize_image(img_rays[r], scale, lineH + lineO);
		img_rays[r]->instances[0].x = START_PX + r * scale;
		img_rays[r]->instances[0].y = (SCR_HEIGHT / 2) - (lineH + lineO) / 2;
	```

	To change the texture, maybe i will need:
		- img_rays_n
		- img_rays_s
		- img_rays_e
		- img_rays_w
	And make them ->instances[0].*enabled // or disabled
