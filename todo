* Issue v0:
 When repo cloned, the MLX42 MUST BE Compiled in the new address
 Using the same instruction as Codam provided:

	git clone https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42.git
	cd MLX42
	cmake -B build # build here refers to the outputfolder.
	cmake --build build -j4 # or do make -C build -j4

	** RESOLVED!! Marked as DONE!

***

* Convert Raycast into 3D:

 + The Idea:
	- 1* Create an image with the withd & heith of screen
		*(Use the "mlx_new_image"
			&& mlx_image_to_window(mlx, screen, 0, 0))
	- 2* Use the "mlx_put_pixel(screen, x, y, color)"
		** This function will be inside of a while
		** I supose this will work with "lineH" && "lineO"

	-* lineH + lineO
